- Bouncebacks with notifications? Bouncebacks are desired... (NB many universities don't even do this)

- Email opt-in process (trying to catch non-member submitting authors so these folks can receive AACR information)--didn't want to give them a chance to opt-out of the main AACR membership mailing list

- Increases in fraud with journals (more detail needed)

- Endorsers (sub-set of sponsors) are a big pain-point for AACR, drain on their resources, they do validate each of them
	If the search was similar to the sponsor search it would help this process
	Search "again" if they're associates, it's a sub-search now on the sponsors table (as endorsers)
	If there was an email alert that went out notifying the selected sponsor, it would help
	CTT has talked asbout changing how tables are populated, we'd need to review steps

- Web services to populate the sponsorship table -> Parsing down to newly added; already have fields (see report)

- Removal of some search fields to make people have to know their sponsor (not a free-form search)

- Authentication on AACR.org (SSO) and then integrate with the OASIS login (pending AACR completion; try for Spring or Summer 2011)

Top priority: Make the current sponsor update process more efficient; huge win for submitters and internal AACR service-based work
	What is needed? ID the list of fields we need and are feasible to complete
	Meet with an internal resource to ensure nothing is missing; narrate process in our language
	Illustrate how it will change the sponsor-step, estimate it, rank it, execute

- New question for undergrads who wish to join a competition; abstracts are submitted and difficult to weed-out sstudent specific submissions (risk is they could end up in a regular poster session...)

- Can we require a member number for endorsers/sponsors (they have to be members)? Lookup would be the primary goal, but a phone call isn't a huge issue since they'll later have to look this information up regardless



- Confirmation of lookup of co-author to ensure that the selected identity is the intended identity

-Co-author required email field (undecided, need to follow-up); this will impact the completion of data-entry

-Confirmed that the co-author completion of data will NOT hold-up the submission for AACR

- Session Building change idea: search term gets saved when a search is completed/have to click clear

- Capture as integrated vendor, desire to see further pricing/demo of mobile capability

- Validation of slide usage as a part of a notification or OASIS form completion

- Presentation review and edit capabilities; interested in CTTCSC review/annotation process

- Interested in disc and web distribution (eCom capabilities TBD)

- Identify which presentations AACR can make free as next step
